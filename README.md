### 🛡️ A Digital Safety Sanctuary for Ethiopian Women & Girls

**Tracks:** Safety by Design | Survivor Support | Digital Literacy
**Target:** Adolescent Girls (10-24) in Ethiopia

## 🚨 The Problem
In Ethiopia, digital violence is rising on Telegram and Facebook, yet 80% of adolescent girls lack the tools to report it safely. Existing platforms are not anonymous, leading to victim-blaming and re-traumatization.

* **Panic Button:** A "Shake-to-Exit" feature that instantly redirects to Google.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Frontend:** React.js (Mobile First Design)
* **Safety Tech:** Client-side encryption, LocalStorage for offline LMS.
* **Deployment:** Vercel
